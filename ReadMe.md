## This is the back end for a car rental website. <br /> It is built with Node.js and Express.js, and uses MongoDB for data storage. <br /> The back end provides RESTful API endpoints for user authentication, user profile data, car data, and reservation data.

### Getting Started

* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Install dependencies by running npm install.
* Create a .env file and add your MongoDB connection string as MONGODB_URI.
* Run the server with npm start.
